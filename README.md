## Usage

In draw mode, click and drag to draw walls. Use the size and star count sliders to adjust size. Use "Mode: Draw" to toggle modes.
In solve mode, you can solve manually, or let the computer solve for you. Use "Show next step" to show one possible step to make progress in the puzzle. Use "Apply next step" to automatically fill those cells. Use "Auto solve" to fill in the entire puzzle (Warning: may take some time).
